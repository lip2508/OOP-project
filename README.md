# GROUP CODING RULES — MUST FOLLOW

### 1. Filename = Class Name
Example: public class Player must be saved in Player.java (capital P)

### 2. No renaming existing method names

e.g. getStats(), getCurrentHP(), startBattle() — don't change the names unless discussed.
**REMEMBER** Please check the other teammates code to see the existing method names to avoid conflicts and errors

### 3. Don’t delete or recomment anyone else’s class/methods

If you're working in the same file as others, just add a new comment or discuss in group chats if there are adjustment needed.

### 4. Do not create duplicate classes

If someone is working on Pokemon.java, don’t create pokemon1.java or PokemonCopy.java

### 5. Add comments for each method and class

Helps everyone else understand what the code does

### 6. Compile frequently
```
javac *.java
```

### 7. Pull before you push

```
git pull origin main  // Or whatever your branch is
git add .
git commit -m "Update Game & MysteryBox logic"
git push
```
